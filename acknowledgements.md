These materials have been developed with the support of [PR Informatics](https://www.prinformatics.com/). The first in-person workshop was held in Glasgow, Scotland, UK, 29. Oct - 2 Nov. 2018 ([course page](https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-to-bioinformatics-for-dna-and-rna-sequence-analysis-ibdr01/)). For future offerings by PR Informatics (including this workshop) please visit the [upcoming courses page](https://www.prinformatics.com/courses/).

PR informatics provides training courses and workshops in bioinformatics and associated fields. Each course we deliver comprises of a carefully thought out combination of lectures, group discussions and hands on practicals. We believe it is this combination of teaching mediums that underpins the success of our courses and workshops.

This work would not be possible without building upon what others have contributed to the bioinformatics community. We would like to thank the authors of the bioinformatic tools and resources upon which this tutorial is based.

Some of the methods/tools used in this course (e.g. pvactools and regtools) were supported by funding to Malachi Griffith from the [V Foundation for Cancer Research](https://www.jimmyv.org/).

Creation of the section on Amazon AWS EC2 and the cost of student instances was generously supported by [Amazon AWS Education grants](http://aws.amazon.com/grants/).

This research benefited from the use of credits from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Cloud Credits Model Pilot, a component of the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) program.

In addition to the main [Authors](/authors) of this workshop (Obi Griffith, Malachi Griffith, Zachary Skidmore, Huiming Xia, Jeff Szymanski, Sharon Freshour, Erica Barnell, and Katie Campbell), we would also like to thank the following researchers who contributed to lecture or exercise materials that inspired some aspects of this workshop: Aaron Quinlan, Elaine Mardis, Andrew Farrell, Maryn Meltz Steinberg, Sorana Morrissy, Jim Robinson, Ben Ainscough,Cody Ramirez, Jason Walker, Jasreet Hundal, and many more.

Finally, we would like to thank the students who participated and contributed in many ways to development of these materials.
